## Overview

Developed a comprehensive **IoT Emergency Button System** designed to provide immediate alerts in critical situations. The system integrates hardware (ESP32) with a robust software backend to ensure reliable message delivery and real-time monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Hardware Integration**: Utilized **ESP32** microcontrollers coupled with physical push buttons to trigger alerts.
- **Real-time Communication**: Implemented **MQTT** protocol for low-latency messaging between the device and the server.
- **Backend API**: Built a RESTful API using **Laravel** to handle device authentication, alert logging, and data persistence.
- **Live Dashboard**: Created a real-time dashboard to display active alerts, device status, and location data for emergency responders.

## Technical Stack

- **Hardware**: ESP32, Physical Buttons, WiFi Module
- **Protocol**: MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP), MySQL
- **Frontend**: Blade Templates, JavaScript

## Outcome

The system successfully demonstrated sub-second latency for alert transmission, providing a reliable proof-of-concept for safety and security applications in office buildings and public spaces.
