## Modernizing the WAN

As applications move to the cloud, traditional MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) networks often struggle with cost and flexibility. SD-WAN (Software-Defined WAN) has emerged as a compelling alternative.

### Comparison

*   **Cost:** SD-WAN is generally more cost-effective as it can leverage standard internet links.
*   **Performance:** SD-WAN optimizes traffic path selection in real-time.
*   **Security:** SD-WAN offers integrated security features and centralized policy management.
*   **Reliability:** MPLS typically offers better SLAs for packet delivery, though SD-WAN mitigates this with link aggregation.

For many organizations, a hybrid approach or a full transition to SD-WAN provides the agility needed for the digital era.
