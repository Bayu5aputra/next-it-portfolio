## Why Zero Trust?

In today's interconnected world, the traditional "castle-and-moat" security model is obsolete. With remote work, cloud adoption, and mobile devices, the perimeter has dissolved. Zero Trust operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify."

### Key Principles

1.  **Verify Explicitly:** Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
2.  **Use Least Privileged Access:** Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA).
3.  **Assume Breach:** Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption.

Implementing Zero Trust is not just about technology; it's a mindset shift that ensures your organization's data remains secure regardless of where it resides or who is accessing it.
