## Hello World!

Welcome to my new portfolio website. I've redesigned this space to better showcase my work as an **IT Infrastructure Engineer** and **Software Developer**.

### What to Expect

This site is built with **Next.js** for performance and SEO, featuring **Custom Animations** (Splash Screen, True Focus, Variable Proximity) to provide a unique user experience.

Here, you'll find:
- **Deep Dives**: Case studies on my projects, from IoT systems to full-stack applications.
- **Insights**: Technical articles about what I'm learning in Networking and Software Dev.
- **Experiments**: Creative coding and UI explorations.

Feel free to explore my [Projects](/work) or check out the [Gallery](/gallery) to see what I've been up to.

Stay tuned for more!
