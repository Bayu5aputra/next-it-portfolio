## IIoT: Industry 4.0

The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to interconnected sensors, instruments, and other devices networked together with computers' industrial applications, including manufacturing and energy management.

### Benefits

*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Sensors track machinery health, preventing costly downtime.
*   **Enhanced Efficiency:** Real-time data allows for optimized resource usage.
*   **Improved Safety:** Automated monitoring reduces human exposure to hazardous environments.

As IIoT adoption grows, the convergence of IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology) becomes critical for unlocking new levels of productivity.
