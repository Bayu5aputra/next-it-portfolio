## Intelligent Traffic Control

Adaptive Traffic Control Systems (ATCS), often referred to as Smart APIL (Alat Pemberi Isyarat Lalu Lintas), are changing the way cities manage traffic flow. Instead of fixed timers, these systems respond to real-time traffic conditions.

### How It Works

*   **Sensors & Cameras:** Detect vehicle presence and queue lengths at intersections.
*   **Centralized Control:** Data is processed to adjust signal timing dynamically.
*   **Priority for Emergency Vehicles:** Green waves can be created for ambulances and fire trucks.

Smart APIL systems significantly reduce waiting times, fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions.
