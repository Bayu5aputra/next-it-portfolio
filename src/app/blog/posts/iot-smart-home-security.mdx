## Smart but Vulnerable

Smart home devices—from thermostats to refrigerators—offer convenience but often lack robust security features. They can become entry points for hackers into your home network.

### Common Vulnerabilities

*   **Weak Default Passwords:** Many devices come with easily guessable default credentials.
*   **Lack of Updates:** Manufacturers may stop supporting devices, leaving vulnerabilities unpatched.
*   **Insecure Communication:** Data transmission between devices and the cloud is often not encrypted.

### Mitigation Strategies

*   Change default passwords immediately.
*   Isolate IoT devices on a separate guest network.
*   Disable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) on your router.
*   Purchase devices from reputable manufacturers with a history of security updates.
