## V2I Communication

The next generation of APIL systems involves Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. Traffic lights will communicate directly with connected and autonomous vehicles.

### Benefits

*   **Speed Advisory:** Vehicles receive optimal speed recommendations to catch green lights (Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory - GLOSA).
*   **Safety Alerts:** Warnings about red light violations or pedestrians in crosswalks.
*   **Data-Driven Planning:** City planners gain granular data on traffic patterns for better infrastructure design.

Connected APIL serves as the backbone for a safer, more efficient urban transportation ecosystem.
