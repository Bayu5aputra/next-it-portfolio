## Beyond Speed

5G is not just about faster download speeds on your smartphone. It is a fundamental shift in network architecture that enables massive machine-type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC).

### Key Features

*   **Low Latency:** Critical for applications like autonomous driving and remote surgery.
*   **Network Slicing:** Dedicated virtual networks for specific use cases over the same physical infrastructure.
*   **High Density:** Supports a massive number of connected devices per square kilometer.

5G is the enabler for the true realization of IoT and Smart Cities.
