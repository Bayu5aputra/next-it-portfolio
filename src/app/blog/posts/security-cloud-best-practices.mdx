## Cloud Security Challenges

Moving to the cloud offers scalability and flexibility, but it also introduces new security challenges. Misconfigurations, inadequate access controls, and insecure APIs are common vulnerabilities.

### Best Practices

*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Implement strong IAM policies. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users.
*   **Encryption:** Encrypt data both at rest and in transit. Manage your own encryption keys when possible.
*   **Regular Audits:** Continuously monitor and audit your cloud environment for compliance and security gaps.
*   **Security by Design:** Integrate security into the DevOps pipeline (DevSecOps) to catch vulnerabilities early.

By adopting these practices, organizations can confidently leverage the power of the cloud while maintaining a robust security posture.
