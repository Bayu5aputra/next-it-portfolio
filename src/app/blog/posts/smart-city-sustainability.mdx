## Green Tech for Urban Spaces

Sustainability is a key driver for smart city initiatives. By integrating technology into urban planning, cities can reduce their carbon footprint and create healthier environments.

### Examples

*   **Energy Management:** Smart grids and energy-efficient buildings reduce consumption.
*   **Water Conservation:** Leak detection sensors and smart irrigation systems minimize waste.
*   **Monitor Air Quality:** Deployment of IoT sensors to track pollution levels in real-time.

Smart technology acts as an enabler for achieving long-term sustainability goals, making cities more resilient and livable.
